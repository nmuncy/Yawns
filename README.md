Scripts used for template construction and pre-processing in the Sleep-Food-BMI study

Basic Notes:

Scripts that start with "TT" were used for creating the template, otherwise the script is for processing the study data.
Scripts are numbered (e.g. *_1.sh, *_2.sh) to indicate their respective step in the pipeline.
Supercomputer scripts are written for either a qsub or slurm environment, and are wrapped with submit_sbatch scripts.
